##About
This repository holds a presentation I prepared for class on the [Shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm). If you're overwhelmed, I'll try to explain what every folder / file is for.

`index.html`: The presentation itself.

`code`: The folder that contains the actual C code to implement the algorithm (that we need for class).

`css, js, lib, plugin`: Resources required by RevealJS (the library I used for the presentation).

`img`: All the glorious GIFs we use

`tool`: The ugly code for the step-by-step visualizer I made.
