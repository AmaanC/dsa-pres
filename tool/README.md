##Motivation

I made this for a class presentation. The reason was: Laziness.

I didn't want to manually write out the steps for all the examples I'd like to present in class, so I wrote this.

##Working

Its working is fairly simple. It runs the simple infix to postfix algorithm with an additional `saveStep` function in the middle, which draws the current states to a canvas.
